	    <h2>Wumpus Coding Dojo, Take 2: Exploring Diversity</h2>

		<p>On Thursday March 14th from 3 to 6 pm is Iterate organizing a coding dojo focused at exploring diversity of approaches and coding styles. We warmly invite interested coders to participate - just let us know at 
			<a href="mailto:tech@iterate.no">tech@iterate.no</a> that you are comming so that we can check for space and get food.

		We have recently had a TDD coding dojo, creating the Wumpus game. The dojo was done in the traditional style (one PC, coders taking turns). This time we want to experiment with a more coding-intensive organisation and with focus on creating and exploring diversity of designs. The programming language will be Java.
	</p>

	<h3>About the dojo</h3>

	<p>Unique value proposition:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Focus on how different starting points lead to different things</li>
		<li>Learn from diversity of approaches</li>
		<li>Everybody programming all the time</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Rules and tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>TDD and testing are optional (though encouraged) - the one coding decides</li>
		<li>You do not have enough time to finish the game so do not try to achieve that. Decide what you want to focus on: testing, slicing the requirements as thin as possible (so that you actually can finish a very primitive and minimalist game), pair-programming, exploring different designs, .. .</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Dojo organization:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>People split into pairs</li>
		<li>We describe the possible starting points of the design (the features and facets of the game) and challenge each team to choose one, preferably one that is likely to be different from the other teams</li>
		<li>Each team has 5 minutes to discuss the design and development plan</li>
		<li>Coding starts; after 15 min, one on the pair moves clock-wise to the next team. Since the newly arrived team member doesn’t know the design, it is recommended that s/he is the driver (i.e. coding) while the old team member is the navigator, telling the coder what to do.</li>
		<li>It is up to the team to decide how they will alternate (if at all) by the keyboard in the 15 min they have until the older team member must leave for the next team. They can switch the driver-navigator roles after 7.5 min or as they wish. Go to 4.</li>
		<li>After 6 or 10 rounds (1.5h or 2.5h), the game is over</li>
		<li>Debriefing: What have we learned, what interesting has happened? (5-10 min)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note: Possible design starts:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Game end conditions (wumpus shot, hero eaten, hero self-shot)</li>
		<li>Shooting</li>
		<li>Movement</li>
		<li>Senses (smelling the wumpus, die)</li>
		<li>AI for moving wumpus (nice-to-have)</li>
		<li>Player user interface (nice-to-have)</li>
		<li>Maze generator (nice-to-have)</li>
		<li>Game space representation (note: 2D array is NOT the only suitable or best representation)</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>About the Hunt the Wumpus Game</h3>

	<p>Note: There are many features of the game. We will likely focus on the minimal subset (no pits, bats, or gold), for example - only wumpus, hero and movement / shooting should be fine.</p>

	<h3>Organization</h3>

	<p>
		Place: Iterate office, Bygdøy allé 21, Oslo
	</p>

	<p>Food and drinks will be served during the dojo.</p>

	<p>
		The programming language will be this time Java and the prefered environment is IntelliJ on Mac
		(not because it is necessarilly the best one but because most of us are familiar with it 
		and the less environments the easier to rotate).
