-# THIS NEEDS WORK =)
-# The idea is to find the next upcoming event where featured in frontmatter is set to true.
-# This partial should then fetch the description from frontmatter, and display it on all event pages that are not currently featured.
-# The layout takes care of which partials are displayed on which page.

-# INSPIRATION FOR HOW THIS COULD LOOK:
-# (it doesn't exactly work like that)

%h2.text-centered VÃ¥rt neste arrangement
-# %h3.text-centered= page.data.title
.eight-columns-centered
  -# %p= page.data.short_description
